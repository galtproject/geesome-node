# Chat Module

The `chat` module owns the durable server-side boundary for browser-first secure
chat. It registers signed public device bundles, verifies signed encrypted
events, assigns deterministic per-conversation sequences, stores recipient
indexes, and records received/read receipts.

The module never accepts browser private keys, plaintext messages, plaintext
attachments, or attachment keys. Its event rows contain the opaque
`geesome-e2ee-v2` envelope emitted by `geesome-libs`.

Live communicator or PubSub notifications are optional hints. Durable
inter-node delivery, acknowledgements, retry leases, and head reconciliation
must use these stored events as their source of truth.
